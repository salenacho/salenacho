Hi, I’m Salena! 

I'm a beginner coder and I hope this will become a  place for me to interact with others, collaborate on projects, and enhance my coding skill!
I’m interested in learning about AI & its applications, especially in the field of healthcare. As of right now, I am only familiar with Python, but I am hoping to learn other languages eventually.

You can reach me through my email: salenacho05@gmail.com!
Thank you so much ^o^ <3
